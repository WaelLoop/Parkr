    brief: Delete a membership.
    description: |
      This command deletes the membership resource of a registered cluster on the Hub.
      It will not remove the connect-agent that was installed on the cluster during cluster
      registration. To delete the membership of a registered cluster and remove the connect-agent,
      consider using the `{parent_command} unregister` command.
