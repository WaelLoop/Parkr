        GKE cluster self-link of the cluster represented by this membership;
        for example,
        '//container.googleapis.com/projects/my-project/locations/us-central1-a/clusters/my-cluster.'
        This is only valid if the represented cluster is a GKE cluster. The
        provided self-link will be validated to confirm that it maps to the
        cluster represented by this membership.
